A real time CV generator. Edit the inputs and once you are done, download the PDF to you machine. In a large enough screen you can view the changes to your CV in real time, while in smaller screens you will have to click the "Preview CV" button to view the changes. You can also click the "Auto Fill Form" to fill the forms for you, with information from the RandomAPI service.

Problems yet to be fixed:
- When you download a PDF with the forms filled with data from the API, the user generated photo is not printed on the PDF.
- In smaller screens, the cv is not generated properly, its content is taking way too much space. I'll have to update the CSS of the CV preview DIV so that it uses fixed width and height values, instead of using porcentage based values and flexbox. To fit smaller screens with fixed height and width, i will add a transform style that decreases the scale of the CV Preview based on the size of the mobile device screen.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
